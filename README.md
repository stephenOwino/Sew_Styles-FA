# Sew_Styles-FA

SewStyle is a web application I developed to connect clients with skilled tailors across Kenya. The platform streamlines the process of finding, engaging with, and paying for tailoring services, and includes additional features to enhance the user experience:

Interactive Map: Clients can view their location and find nearby tailors on an easy-to-use map.
Tailor Directory: Browse through a list of local tailors, review their services, and place orders directly.
Chat Functionality: Communicate directly with tailors through an integrated chat feature to discuss details and requirements.
Clothing Browsing: Clients can browse various clothing items, save pictures, and like their favorite options. This feature helps in organizing and sharing their clothing preferences with tailors.
SewStyle improves the tailoring experience by reducing search time, facilitating seamless communication, and offering tools for clients to manage and express their clothing needs effectively.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
